# Changes since part 2

In part 2, I have identified that my target audience should be business owners and CXO level managers in traditional industries, such as argriculture, retail, and manufacture. I will continue to focus on the group of target audience in my final presentation.

According to part 2, I have received many useful comments on my final presentation, and I have listed a few changes that I am going to implement in my final presentation.
