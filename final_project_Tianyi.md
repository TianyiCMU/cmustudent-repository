# Outline
## Summary: 
I would like to make a simple webpage, for a start-up IT consulting company. I would like to use the webpage to illustrate the importance of Information Technology in different industries, and to get potential clients, especially these have not yet invested in IT before, interested about the services we can provide for them. 

## Project Structure:
First, I want to present the general picture of the IT and Business Intelligence. I want to show the definition of IT, and what it can be used to drive business impacts. 

Second, I want to generate a big picture of the situation of IT in the business world. I will do this by creating a comparison chart using the situation from five years ago and now. 

Next, I will dig into specific industries. For conventional industries such as agriculture, healthcare and retail where the importance of IT are not widely recognized, I want to show the power of IT by using different visualizations of business cases. 

Following, I will show that although certain industries have fallen behind in the race of IT, things are changing nowadays. Many traditional companies have implemented technology tools and strategies. If the reader has not done so, then his or her companies are in danger. 

Finally, I will present our previous successful cases to our readers. No worries if you have not applied IT before. Our company can help you catch up with your competitors. Our previous clients have experienced a significant improvement using our consulting services using our services in IT. 

In the end, I want my readers to action today, by contacting our salesperson for detailed information about our business cases and services.

# Sketches
First, I used a pyramid to illustrate different levels of IT development that I learnt from my past internships and classes. I will use different shades of blues from bottom to the top to show that there is an increasing level of intelligence from basic IT infrastructures to higher level of business predictions using advanced technologies.

Second, to show the general picture of the development of IT in business, I use the data of company spending on IT as a percentage of revenue. The higher the spending, the higher the importance of IT to companies in general. We can see that in the past five years, companies tend to spend more in IT.

Third, in order to show the development of IT in different industries, I use the bubble graph. The vertical line is the same as the previous graph, which is the company spending on IT as a percentage of revenue, and the horizontal line is the level of intelligence. I measure the level of intelligence using McKinsey's Digitalization Index from their reports.

Fourth, I want to show my readers that they are well behind their competitors if they have not done any of IT related development in the past. If they have not begun digitalization, they are now at least 46% behind.

Finally, to complete my story, I want my readers to go back to the first chart of the presentation. Depending on our previous successful cases, we can drive our clients into a higher level of intelligence, and also promise a boost in revenue for our clients in the long run.

# Data
For the first data visualization, I simply use the idea from my past experiences to create the pyramid chart. The content may be derived from various concepts but the idea is original.

For the second graph, I combine the sources of Techvera and a report from Deloitte Consulting. The sources are listed below:
https://techvera.com/how-much-should-a-company-spend-on-it/
https://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=2626
https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/cio-insider-business-insights/tech-finance-technology-investment-budgeting-processes.html

For the third bubble chart, I combine the sources of McKinsey's Digitalization Index and reports from the Internet:
https://www.flexera.com/blog/technology-value-optimization/it-spending-by-industry/
https://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=2626
https://www.researchgate.net/figure/McKinsey-Global-Institute-industry-digitization-index-201513_fig1_336150205

For the fourth graph, I use the existing source of a survey:
https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/digitization-index-for-businesses-corona-accelerates-digitization-in-medium-sized-businesses-613546

For the fifth graph, it is a replica of the first pyramid chart. Since the consulting company is fictional, the potential boost in revenue of clients is also fictional, so I just make up the data and will try to enrich the data using cases of other consulting companies if required.


# Method and medium
Since my deliverable is a webpage, so I would like to use Shorthand for my final project. Ideally, it will be the homepage of a start-up consulting company or a subpage of the main website. I will use story map to continue polishing my story and sketches, and I will use the moodboard to check whether my story fits the flow of moods of my target audience.

For the data visualization charts, I will mainly use flourish, and will use colorbrewer to choose proper colors. These two websites are widely used in my previous projects.
