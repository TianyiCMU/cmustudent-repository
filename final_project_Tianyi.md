# Changes since part 2

In part 2, I have identified that my target audience should be business owners and CXO level managers in traditional industries, such as argriculture, retail, and manufacture. I will continue to focus on the group of target audience in my final presentation.

According to part 2, I have received many useful comments on my final presentation, and I have listed a few changes that I am going to implement in my final presentation.

First, I polished Oliver's story to make it consistent throughout the whole presentation. Audience will not lose Oliver this time. Second, I managed to create more data visualizations describing Oliver's problem to make it more clear to the audience. I also got useful suggestions from the TA and the professor. Kara specifically said I should explain more on why digitalization is important for a company. As a result, I added more contents on what digitalization can do for companies. I also added lengends to visualizations that were unclear to readers previously. I changed the color used in my visualizations, to make them more consistent. 

Particularly, during the whole process of building up my final presentation, I found the mood board and richness of information chart quite useful. In the early stage, it can help you generate the outline of the story you are going to tell. With the help of mood board, I can easily track the emotional trend of my audience, to create a useful and emotionally rich call to action in the end. Although they were made in the early stage of the preparation of my final presentation, I followed them until the end.
