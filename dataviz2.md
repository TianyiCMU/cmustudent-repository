# The original data visualization
While browsing through the CMU website, I found this particular data visualization that intersted me. The visualization is the positive COVID cases related to CMU faculties and students, and including those on campus and off campus. The data are presented both in by week format and in by month format. The charts and links are shown below:

I particularly chose the data for three reasons:

First, the data presented are important and are concerned by most people. Since the development of the COVID-19, it has been the hotest issue among all people. Especially for students and faculties who are unable to stay quarantine because of the coursework, we can interested in receiving updated and clear information about the development of COVID-19 cases on campus. As a result, improving the quality of the data visualization of COVID cases on CMU website is important.

Second, the visualization has pleanty of rooms to improve. As discussed in my Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile spreadsheet, the colors, the labels, the type of visualization have rooms to improve. The visualization chart contains too much information for readers to absorb, and unclear labels create boundaries for audience to catch up with the information effectively and efficiently.

Third, the data is relatively easy to access. Luckily, CMU provides a Google spreadsheet for us to dig into the original data, and set up a friendly environment for further improvements.

# Wireframing
As discussed before, I would like to reduce the colors, change the type of visualization for the by month graph, and add clear labels to the graph. As a result, I have done my first wireframing visualization chart using pens:
