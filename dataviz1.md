# Comparison of Three Visualizations
The first graph is the default graph generated on the OECD website. It uses a bar chart in ascending order to show different debt-to-GDP ratios. It is clear to see that there are differences between each country and we can tell which country has the largest debt-to-GDP ratio and which country has the lowest. However, since the number of countries are relatively high, which is more than 30, the bars make audience lose their focus and interst. We also cannot find out a common pattern between each bar, so it is hard to draw conclusions with such visualization.
The second graph is the grid of line charts. It shows how the ratio is growing over time, and it contains more information than the previous chart. We can see that there is a pattern over time, and countries tend to have growing debt-to-GDP ratio. We can also discover interesting years such as 2008 and 2009 where debt-to-GDP ratio are booming for some countries from the chart. The color in the second graph is also clearer than the first graph in the sense that the first graph only contains different degrees of blue, while the second graph uses red and grey to construct a contrast color set for readers to focus.
I used the world map template on flourish to create the thrid visualization. I specifically choose 2019 for visualization since large data tend to distract audience's attention, and the most recent data is enough for us to interpret interesting results. I choose red as my color to represent different debt-to-GDP ratio since red in convention means alert. By default, a larger debt-to-GDP ratio means a higher risk for the country's economy. I choose grey as the backgournd color to avoid other distractions. By zooming into Europe, we can see that European and other developed countries tend to have a higher ratio of debt in contrast to Asian developing countries. It is something we cannot see clearly from two previous charts. By grouping coutries by their geographical regions using the world map, we can classify different characteristics of countires relative to their debt-to-GDP ratio.
