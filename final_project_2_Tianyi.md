# User research and interviews

## Target audience

Since I am about to represent an IT consulting company, providing consulting services to our clients regarding digitalization, my target audience is business owners and CXO level managers. For business owners that are interested in digitalization, they have to be in traditional industries. The reason is that, traditional industries are relatively less advanced in digitalization, compared to industries such as Internet. As a result, my target audience is business owners in traditional industries, such as argriculture, retail, and manufacture. I hope everyone listening to my presentation will get in the position of a traditional business owner who wishes to digitalize his or her business.

## Identifying representatives

In order to select interviewees, I choose three representatives related to my target audience. First, I contacted my internship supervisor, A. A was my supervisor when I was in Accenture, an international IT consulting company providing services that are similar to my presentation. Second, I asked one of my relatives, B, who is a small business owner but have no previous knowledge of digitalization. Hopefully he can offer me some business insights as a business owner from real life. Third, I asked my classmate, C, to be my last interviewee. She is a good representative for my audience when I will give my speech in class.


## Interview script

Here are the questions and their answers:

- What do you see and capture at first sight? What is this story about?

>A: I can see that you are trying to pitch a digitalization idea to audiences

>B: It is about a digitalization case for business owners

>C: It is like a selling commercial for an IT consulting company

- What do you think is the target audience?

>A: Business owners

>B: Business owners

>C: Traditional business owners

- Are there any places you find awkward or confusing?

>A: I find that the transition to the call to action slide is a little bit weird. You can search for more data related to previous successful cases of digitalization of companies and tries to add more visualizations in between.

>B: I get lost when Oliver no longer appears in the story. What is the purpose for Oliver's appearance in the first?

>C: I am not quite sure where Oliver has been. Are all the questions in the title been asked by Oliver?

- Are there any places you find me doing well or bad?

>A: I think the Oliver's story is intriguing. It interests me.

>B: I like your visualizations and they are powerful in coveying your message.

>C: I like the Oliver's story and the meme. I think you can provide more memes to attract the audience.

## Findings from interviews & Changes for next week

Interviewees have mixed opinions towards Oliver's story. My original purpose is to have Oliver's story illustrated from the beginning to the end. For some reasons the idea is not clearly captured by audiences. I will definitely keep the story because two of my interviewees gave positive feedback on the intriguing story. But the way of stroy-telling needs to be polished. I will try to tell a consistent story of Oliver's business instead of using him for an intriguing hook.

Other suggestions such as adding more slides and visualizations for previous cases might be hard to achieve, since finding relevant data is difficult. I will try to find them on the Internet and hopefully I can add more visualizations to smooth the story into call to action. However, it cannot be guranteed.

Also, adding more memes is hard to achieve, since memes are usually generated by authors on the Internet and the copyright of them can be difficult to figure out. In order to avoid copyright issues, I should try to use less images and memes as possible and let the data to tell the story.
