# README
This is my portfolio for CMU course ---- 94870 Telling Stories with Data


# About me
I am Tianyi Wang, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon majoring in Information Systems Management. I am expected to graduate on May 2022, and would like to work as a business analyst/data analyst as my future career. Previously I have earned a bachelor degree in Finance from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I have interned in several consulting and Internet companies in China, and my roles include IT consulting analyst and strategy data analyst. 


# What I hope to learn
I have discovered my weakness of data interpreting in my previous internships. As a result, I would like to learn more about data visualization techniques and methodologies in this class.
